# CS50-PSet-5-Speller

This is my code of the program that spell-checks a file, using a hash table, for Harvard's CS50 problems set 5.

## Specifications:

Implement, in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized.
